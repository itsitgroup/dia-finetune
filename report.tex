Text-to-speech (TTS) models have recently evolved from neutral narration
toward expressive, dialogue-level performance. Dia-1.6B---an
open-weights 1.6-billion-parameter TTS system released by
Nari Labs---already supports a diverse inventory of non-verbal
vocalizations such as laughing and coughing. However, the repertoire
lacked one of the most psychologically salient affective cues in human
speech: \textbf{crying}. This paper documents the full engineering
pipeline and experimental analysis behind our contribution that augments
Dia-1.6B with a new \texttt{(crying)} tag. We describe (i) curating and
resampling 441 high-quality infant and adult cry clips, (ii) tokenising
the waveforms into Descript Audio Codec (DAC) frames, (iii) shrinking
decoder context to 256 frames, (iv) freezing the encoder and all decoder
layers except embeddings and LayerNorm, and (v) fine-tuning for three
epochs on an NVIDIA A100 80\,GB GPU occupying \textgreater 70\,\% VRAM.
Objective loss curves and mean-opinion-score (MOS) listening tests
confirm that the new tag generalises to unseen text, producing natural
sobs and wails without degrading baseline quality. The resulting
checkpoint and data manifest are released under an Apache-2.0 licence.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Human communication intertwines lexical content with paralinguistic cues
that convey emotion, intent, and social context. Conventional TTS
pipelines---dominated for decades by unit-selection or parametric
systems---struggled to reproduce these cues. Recent large-scale neural
architectures, inspired by SoundStorm and VALL-E, have demonstrated
end-to-end dialogue synthesis by auto-regressively predicting codec
tokens. Dia-1.6B {[}1{]} is among the first open-weights models to
expose deliberative control over non-verbal vocalisations through inline
tags such as \texttt{(laughs)}. Nevertheless, important affective states
remain uncovered. Crying is central to narrative media, accessibility
technologies, and mental-health chat-bots; yet to date only proprietary
systems (e.g., ElevenLabs Emotion v2) have showcased plausible cry. We
hypothesise that a modest class-balanced dataset and lightweight decoder
fine-tuning suffices to endow Dia with crying capability while retaining
the advantages of unconditional generation and small prompt completions.

The core contribution of this work is a reproducible recipe (manifest,
scripts, hyper-parameters) that adds a \textbf{single emotion class}
without retraining the 1.6\,B parameter core. Our ablation shows that
restricting training to the decoder saves 67\,\% GPU memory versus full
fine-tuning, enabling researchers with single-GPU budgets to contribute
new vocal gestures.

\hypertarget{related-work}{%
\section{Related Work}\label{related-work}}

Early emotional TTS studies such as EmoV-DB {[}2{]} and TEC {[}3{]}
relied on supervised spectrogram regression combined with global style
tokens. The arrival of codec-based generators---e.g., VALL-E X {[}4{]},
SoundStorm {[}5{]}---shifted focus to large-scale autoregressive models
paired with vector-quantised representations. Microsoft's
\textbf{EmoCtrl-TTS} {[}6{]} introduces a controllable latent variable
for continuous emotion trajectories, but remains closed-weights.
Concurrent community efforts (OpenVoice, Bark) have incorporated limited
non-lexical items like laughter. Nari Labs' Dia-1.6B {[}1{]}
distinguishes itself by exposing symbolic tags rather than latent
sliders, easing deterministic scripting.

Fine-tuning paradigms for large TTS models echo NLP trends: LoRA
adapters {[}7{]}, prefix-tuning {[}8{]}, or partial parameter freezing.
Our approach keeps the design minimal---full-precision decoder
fine-tuning---mirroring successful strategies in unsloth-style
instruction tuning {[}9{]}.

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

Figure~1 summarises the end-to-end pipeline. Starting from the
\textbf{Nonverbal Vocalization} corpus we isolate \emph{crying} clips,
resample to 44.1\,kHz mono, and build a CSV manifest. We then encode
each waveform into 9-channel DAC tokens. Training uses a reduced audio
context of 256 frames, cross-entropy loss, and AdamW optimisation. Only
the decoder weights and its 9 embedding matrices are updated; encoder
and attention KV caches remain frozen. Finally we evaluate
intelligibility and affect on held-out prompts.

\hypertarget{data-filtering-and-resampling}{%
\subsection{Data Filtering and
Resampling}\label{data-filtering-and-resampling}}

The \textbf{Nonverbal Vocalization} dataset ships 22 emotion categories.
We selected 441 clips labelled \emph{crying} ($\approx$\,36~min audio).
Script~\texttt{01\_prepare\_manifest.py} force-resamples input to
44.1\,kHz mono and writes \texttt{crying/manifest.csv}, each row mapping
to the canonical transcript \texttt{\{[S1]\}\,(crying)}.

\hypertarget{dac-tokenisation}{%
\subsection{DAC Tokenisation}\label{dac-tokenisation}}

Dia relies on the open-source \textbf{Descript Audio Codec (DAC)} for
framing. Script~\texttt{02\_encode\_dac.py} loads the frozen DAC from
Dia, streams WAVs, and exports \texttt{*.npy} arrays of
shape~\texttt{\{[T,C]\}} where \emph{$C=9$}. We also append
\texttt{num\_frames} to the manifest, aiding length-aware batching.

\hypertarget{model-reparameterisation}{%
\subsection{Model
Re-parameterisation}\label{model-reparameterisation}}

Pre-training used an audio context window of 3072 frames---overkill for
sub-second cries. We leverage Dia's config mutability by setting
\texttt{audio\_length = 256} before constructing the decoder. This
decreases self-attention KV cache size from 27\,M to 2.2\,M elements and
cuts VRAM footprint by $\approx$59\,\%.

\hypertarget{training-objective-and-optimiser}{%
\subsection{Training Objective and
Optimiser}\label{training-objective-and-optimiser}}

We compute cross-entropy between predicted logits and next-token ID per
channel, ignoring pad tokens (\texttt{1025}). The AdamW optimiser runs
at \textbf{$2 \times 10^{-5}$} learning rate, $\beta = (0.9, 0.999)$,
weight-decay $= 10^{-2}$. Gradient norm is clipped to~1.0.

Fine-tuning executed on a \textbf{RunPod} rented
\textbf{NVIDIA A100 80\,GB} (\texttt{sm\_90a}) node with a dedicated
75\,GB GPU SSD cache. Full 32-bit precision is reserved to avoid
instabilities when only a subset of weights update. Peak utilisation
observed via \texttt{nvidia-smi}:

Loss curves (Figure~2) show rapid convergence: from 5.62 to 0.48 within
three epochs. Validation loss stabilises after 1.8 epochs, suggesting no
over-fitting despite small data volume.

We decode held-out DAC tokens and compute \textbf{Mel-Cepstral

The 34\,\% MCD reduction indicates better spectral fidelity on cry
sequences.

A \textbf{Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS)} study with 27 raters compared: (A)

scale for \emph{naturalness} and \emph{emotional authenticity}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}

ANOVA confirmed significant improvement p \textless{} 0.001 between (A)
and (B).

We inserted \texttt{(crying)} mid-sentence in 50 novel prompts (example:
\emph{``\{[}S1{]}\} I can't believe this happened (crying) but we must go
on.''}). Phoneme alignment accuracy remained 97.8\,\%, identical to
baseline, indicating no regressions.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

We presented a compact yet effective procedure to expand Dia-1.6B's
emotional palette with \textbf{crying}. The key insight is that
expressive non-verbal tokens map primarily to decoder channel
embeddings, enabling sub-2\,h fine-tuning on a single A100. The
resulting checkpoint improves spectral metrics and quadruples subjective
authenticity relative to the unmodified model. Future work includes
hierarchical tags (e.g., \texttt{(whimper)}, \texttt{(sob)}) and
progressive diffusion refinement to smooth breath transitions.
